# Digital Image Procession using MATLAB

The academic work I did for my Digital Image Processing class served as the motivation for this repository. In this instance, I used MATLAB for the purpose of image processing. MATLAB is a wonderful software to begin with, despite the fact that I personally prefer Python due to the fact that it is easier and mainly open-source. </br>
The repository is set up with the codes that I used for the many lab tests that I conducted. I have made an effort to present a transparent perspective of each code here.

## LAB 01

  * Call Read Write and Show
  * Color Mapping
  * Read and Rearrange in Subplot
  * RGB to Gray
  * Convert and Subplot RGB
  * Complementary of an Image
