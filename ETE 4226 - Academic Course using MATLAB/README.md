# Digital Image Procession using MATLAB

The academic work I did for my Digital Image Processing class served as the motivation for this repository. In this instance, I used MATLAB for the purpose of image processing. MATLAB is a wonderful software to begin with, despite the fact that I personally prefer Python due to the fact that it is easier and mainly open-source. </br>
The repository is set up with the codes that I used for the many lab tests that I conducted. I have made an effort to present a transparent perspective of each code here.
